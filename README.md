# SnakeLadderGame
p5.js snake and ladders game
I am a newbie in javascript. This is my first javascript project.
The game will be played by kids in the class and the goal is to provide an app that get kids moving with yoga moves.
The game uses the VimeoPlayer api to display video chapters for yoga positions and quiz. Each vimeo video is divided in chapters (functionality available in Vimeo), and a counter is used to each time a chapter is played.
The game can be played by 1-4 players via the Yogis input box.
The board is resized to fit the screen width/height.

Known issues that I would like to fix, but can't figure out how to!!

1- Video does not start on IOS device.
2- Playing sounds give a javascript warning/error ... but it works anyway.

Things that I would like to enhance:

1- charater displacements with a smooth parabol movements (acceleration, gravity).
